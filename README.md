The code has a CNN based algorithm designed which deploy a Tensorflow framework to train and test the generated samples. In the first part of the code, we use the librosa library to extract various features out of an audio signal. In the next part, a model using CNN cells is used to train the generated samples into 10 categories. Full implemetation in the Jupyter notebook is shown.
